Since the project was a single static pseudo web page, i tried to imitate and treat it as a big, real life project, which is why, you'll see tools used which is not primarly necessary for a project this size to be scalable.

Also, note that i had to use icons in png/svg format directly downloaded from figma for 100% accuracy, which is why because of not properly acquiring these assets, the quality of the images is a bit tarnished + the logos aren't vectors, which is why i'm unable to fill in their colors with a hover animation, so instead, i did a simple opacity animation. P.S some of the logos are pro version in fontawesome as well.

Keep in mind that in terms of layout, the design is responsive, however, due to time inefficiency and the fact that there was no mobile layout in figma, the website can only be usable on desktop devices.

Made a custom icon for showing purposes, which is why it's a bit different



Because of time issues, i chose scalability over finishing it fully.
